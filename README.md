### About

This tool lets you extract tiles from inside of a NES, SNES or Genesis ROM and paste them into a separate window, where you can rearrange and recolour them to form an image, which can then be exported to PNG.

The interface is mostly driven by the mouse, with drag-and-drop being the main way to move tiles around.

### Features
